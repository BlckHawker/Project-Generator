By parsing this data, I can easily adjust the layout without needing to modify the content itself. To maintain my portfolio, I frequently update this file, either to make changes to existing projects or add new ones. However, this process can be tedious as several conditions need to be met for the JSON to be read correctly and for the project to display properly. To streamline this process,This GUI was created is to streamline the process of editing or creating a project. There are built in checks in order to verify a project's content is valid.",
